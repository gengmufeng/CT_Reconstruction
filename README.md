# CT_Reconstruction
Crude CT reconstruction simulator using filtered back projection. 

This was a quick implementation to understand the inner workings of the CT reconstruction and scanning process after taking the 3G4, Medical Imaging and Computer Graphics course. 

I'm sure the process can be made quicker, but it works fairly alright with ~angle 1 degree.
